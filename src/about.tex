\section{About}\label{sec:about}

This template provides a full FlakeTeX\parencite{noauthor_hfxbsenixos-config_nodate} setup to get started writing your
LaTeX document instantly.
It is not just a simple LaTeX template but provides additional features like:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{
        \textbf{GitHub Actions integration}:
        Automatically release the matching PDF document on each push.
    }
    \item{
        \textbf{Easy LaTeX setup}:
        Installs LaTeX and the required dependencies reliably and automatically.
        Most additional TeX Live LaTeX packages can be added by just specifying their name in the project configuration
        file.
    }
    \item {
        \textbf{Predictable results}:
        Get the same output document every time thanks to Nix, regardless of where you run it.
    }
\end{itemize}

The template is preconfigured but not limited to use German localization and IEEE as citation style based on the
suggestions of the DHBW-Stuttgart Fakult√§t Technik\parencite{frech_leitlinien_2016}.
